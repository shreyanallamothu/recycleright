<h1>♻️ RecyleRight</h1>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>This is my dad! Like most parents, he doesn’t like to waste. Growing up, I noticed how much effort he went through to research how to properly dispose of everyday items like pizza boxes and plastic bags. And he’s not alone.</p>
<p>A 2025 survey from <a href="https://kab.org/americans-overwhelmingly-support-recycling-yet-rates-remain-stubbornly-low-and-many-dont-get-it-right/">The Harris Poll</a> found that while nearly 90% of Americans think that recycling is important, household recycling rates remain at just 32%—largely due to confusion around proper recycling practices. For example, many people don’t know that pizza boxes with grease can’t be recycled, or that plastic bags cannot be recycled curbside.</p>
<p>I created RecycleRight to help not just my dad, but everyone who wants to recycle correctly without the confusion or endless Googling.</p>
